# Source1KV3CollisionFixer
Short Python script I wrote to automatically fix the collision on all of the models in the Stanley Parable to save me hundreds of hours of manually setting this

## What does this do?
Automatically sets the colission for every single model in a folder to match its original file, saving YOU a shit ton of unneccesary work that Valve would've had you doing for no reason

## Why is it so bulky
I was TOO lazy to make my own KV3 library (I may in the future if I decide to port more games to VR), so I just made a small, janky, script that adds its own physics block to the existing KV3 shit.

## Cool thanks
NP!!!
